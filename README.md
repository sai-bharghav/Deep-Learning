# Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to the Deep Learning Projects repository! This repository features a collection of deep learning experiments, with a current focus on building and utilizing custom datasets.

## 📁 Notebook: Custom_Data_sets.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates:
- How to create and load custom datasets.
- Preprocessing and normalization techniques.
- Training simple deep learning models using Keras/TensorFlow.
- Visualizing model performance and metrics.

This is a great starting point for anyone who wants to train models on their own datasets instead of standard ones like MNIST or CIFAR.
